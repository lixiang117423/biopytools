Visualizing draft genomes in juicebox: 18 July 2016

USAGE: ./run-asm-visualizer.sh [options] <path_to_cprops> <path_to_asm> <path_to_contig_mnd> 

DESCRIPTION:
This is a script to visualize draft assemblies (represented in input by their cprops and asm files) from pairwise contact data represented by Juicer merged_nodups.txt file. The script will produce hic files for viewing in Juicebox as well as scaffold annotation files. Metadata can be attached to the map by passing -i and -g flags with paths to stats and graph files.

ARGUMENTS:
path_to_cprops				Specify cprops file path.
path_to_asm					Specify asm file.
path_to_contig_mnd			Specify path to mnd file describing pairwise Hi-C contacts between assembly contigs.

OPTIONS:
-q mapq						Build map for a specific mapq threshold (default is 1). 
-p true/false				Use GNU Parallel to speed up computation (default is true).
-z zoom						Build map with hardcoded zoom level. By default this is calculated based on the cprops file and applied only to genomes >= 2.1 Gb.

**unprompted**
#-l gap_file				Path to gap bed file - necessary to build contig annotation track.
-m path_to_asm_mnd			Path to mnd already lifted from input to assembly chromosome: used to skip the remapping step.
-n							Skip normalization.
-r							Build for specific resolutions (default is -r 2500000,1000000,500000,250000,100000,50000,25000,10000,5000,1000)
-c							Clean up when done (default: no cleanup.)
-i							Ignore mapq suffix.
-h							Shows this help
