The following problem was encountered by the pre-calculated match lookup service:
Connect to www.ebi.ac.uk:443 [www.ebi.ac.uk/193.62.193.80] failed: Connection refused
Pre-calculated match lookup service failed - analysis proceeding to run locally
============================================================

The pre-calculated match lookup service has been configured in the interproscan.properties file.  
  precalculated match lookup service url : https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/match-lookup
  precalculated match lookup service proxy host :   proxy port : 3128

Unfortunately the web service has failed. Check the configuration of this service
in the interproscan.properties file and, if necessary, set the following property to look like this:

precalculated.match.lookup.service.url=

If the problem persists, check if this is a firewall or proxy issue. If it is a proxy issue, then setting 
the following property in the interproscan.properties file should work:

precalculated.match.lookup.service.proxy.host=
precalculated.match.lookup.service.proxy.port=

If this still does not work please inform the InterPro team of this error
by sending an email to:

interhelp@ebi.ac.uk

In the meantime, the analysis will continue to run locally.
