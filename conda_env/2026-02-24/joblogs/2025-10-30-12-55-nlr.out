   Skipping NLR-Annotator (output exists).
   Sorting GFF and refining NLR regions...
   Extracting FASTA sequences for MAKER...

--- ⚙️ STEP 2: MAKER annotation ---
   ⏳ ACTION REQUIRED: MAKER needs configuration for S1.
   ✅ A template 'maker_opts.ctl' has been created in '/share/org/YZWL/yzwl_lixg/tmp/test_nlr_pipeline/output/S1_analysis/02_maker_run' with cpus=80.
   ‼️ PLEASE EDIT THIS FILE to add ESTs, repeat libraries, and predictor models.
   Then, run MAKER manually from within that directory: cd /share/org/YZWL/yzwl_lixg/tmp/test_nlr_pipeline/output/S1_analysis/02_maker_run && maker
   For large-scale parallelization, consider using MPI: mpiexec -n <cores> maker
   After MAKER finishes, re-run this script to continue.
