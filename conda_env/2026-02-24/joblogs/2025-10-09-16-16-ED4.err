2025-10-09 16:16:57.970633: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI AVX512_BF16 AVX_VNNI AMX_TILE AMX_INT8 AMX_BF16 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
2025-10-09 16:16:58.867162: I tensorflow/core/util/util.cc:169] oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`.
